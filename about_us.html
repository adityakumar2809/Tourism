        <h3>ALL ABOUT TREKAMERICA</h3>
        <p>Back in 2018 we set off on the open road with a van full of young explorers and one mission: To see the real India, and have fun along the way. Today our ethos hasn't changed. We'll show you India's big highlights from bustling cities to jaw-dropping National Parks, and incredible places so hidden only locals like us know about them (but we're happy to share)

        TrekIndia's distinctive style of travel offers something different to your ordinary guided tour or package holiday. Every year thousands of young people from all over the world find that our group adventure holidays offer a great value, easy and dependable and fun way to explore India.</p>
